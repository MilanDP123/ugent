In 1900, sponge divers were retrieving relics from an ancient Greek shipwreck
when archaeologist Spyridon Stais noticed a rock with a gear wheel in it. He had
discovered the Antikythera mechanism, a remarkable clockwork computer that
modeled the movements of heavenly objects as early as 87 B.C.

Using x-ray analysis, historians of science and technology have studied the
mechanism closely and devised several working reconstructions. British orrery
maker John Gleave believes the front dial tracked the sun and moon through the
zodiac year against the Egyptian calendar. Others believe it modeled the motions
of the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn --- every
celestial body known to the ancient Greeks.

That last interpretation is significant: In the first century B.C. Cicero had
written of an instrument "recently constructed by our friend Poseidonius, which
at each revolution reproduces the same motions of the sun, the moon and the five
planets." It may have been used to calculate celestial positions at the times of
certain events or births.

Whatever the details, the device was remarkably sophisticated for its day: Among
other things, it uses a differential gear, which historians had previously
thought was invented in the 16th century. Complex Greek creations like this may
have passed through the Arab world and eventually informed European clockmaking.
What other ancient technology has been lost?
